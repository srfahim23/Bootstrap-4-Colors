# Bootstrap-4-Colors
# Text Colors 
Boostrap 4 has some contextual classes that can be used to provide "meaning through colors".

The classes for text colors are: .text-muted, .text-primary, .text-success .text-info, .text-warning, .text-danger, .text-secondary, .text-white, .text-dark, .text-body, (default body color/often black)and .text-light:

Example follow index.html file

Contextual text classes can also be used on links, which will add a darker hover color:

Example2 : Muted link and danger warning and this is warning.html file.

You can also add 50% opacity for black or white text with the .text-black-50% or .text-white-50 classes:

Note: Example you can see the code opacity.html


# Background Colors
The classes for background colors are: .bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light.

Note  what background colors do not set the text color, so in some caseds you'll wantto use them together with a .text-* class.
